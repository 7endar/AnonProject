# Anon Game Project
A simple 3D hack&slash game I developed using Unity for the Game Technologies course I took as part of my master's degree, prepared using free assets from various sources.

You can access the Unity project files of the game by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvDHCzlOJINA-B1rjevqZx5Njoi7XYjz/view?usp=sharing).

To play the game, [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jweLmhvVnXmHeXgvgmRTjYGDwjDiYJTZ/view?usp=sharing) and run the **AnonProject.exe**.

## Game Levels
The game consists of only two levels.

To pass the first level, all the Anon Stones on the map must be collected. When 4 Anon Stones are in the inventory, the door at the end of the level can be opened, thus proceeding to the final level.

In the final level, after killing the boss, the final door opens with the help of the scroll obtained, and the Obelisk in the room can be destroyed using the area spell, completing the game successfully.

## How to Play
You can left-click on areas where you can move to move your character.

There are three different ways to attack enemies:

- To perform a melee attack, left-click when your cursor is over an enemy.
- Fireball attack is a ranged attack, and to perform it, right-click when your cursor is over an enemy. You need sufficient mana points to use this spell.
- Meteor attack is a ranged attack that can damage multiple targets simultaneously, and to perform it, right-click when your cursor is over an empty area. You need sufficient mana points to use this spell.

Your health and mana points are displayed at the bottom left of the screen, and you can increase them by using potions as long as your potions do not run out, displayed at the bottom right of the screen.

- Press "1" to use a health potion and "2" to use a mana potion.
- To collect potions, simply walk over the potions on the map.

Press "e" to view your inventory.

- In your inventory, you will find collected items as well as weapon and armor slots. To change armor and weapons, select the desired item through the inventory window and place it in the appropriate slot.
- Each item can be placed in its corresponding slot and can have different attack damage, attack speed, and armor values. The equipped armor and weapons will change your character's appearance, and you will see your attack damage and armor points in your inventory.
- To collect armor and weapons, left-click when your cursor is over the items on the map.

Press "q" to access the menu. Through the menu, you can restart the current level, restart the game, or return to the main menu.

## Enemies

In the game, there are four different creatures: spiders, skeletons, trolls, and the boss ghoul.

### Spiders
Spiders are fast-moving creatures that can perform melee attacks. They have low health and attack damage. In the final level, there is also a larger and stronger version.

### Skeletons
Skeletons are creatures with average speed and can perform melee attacks. Their health and attack damage are higher than that of spiders.

### Trolls
Trolls are slow-moving creatures that can perform melee attacks. They have high health and attack damage.

### Ghoul (Boss)
The ghoul is a boss that can perform ranged magic attacks. It has three different attack types:
- Fireball Attack: Similar to the player's spell, this ranged attack deals damage upon hitting the player.
- Freezing Spell: If the player is within a certain area, this spell deals a small amount of damage and significantly reduces the player's movement and attack speed for a temporary period.
- Life Steal Attack: If the player is within a certain area, this attack deals damage to the player and restores the ghoul's health by the same amount of damage dealt.
